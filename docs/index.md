# Planetary Research

**A diamond open access journal for planetary science**

*Planetary Research* is a journal that is being developed by the planetary science community as an alternative to traditional publishers that profit from publicly funded research. The journal will use the *diamond open access* publishing model, which means that there will be no fees for authors and no fees for readers.

Our initiative builds on the experience of several diamond open access journals that have appeared in the Earth sciences since 2018. These journals include [Volcanica](http://www.jvolcanica.org/ojs/index.php/volcanica), [Seismica](https://seismica.library.mcgill.ca/), [Tektonika](https://tektonika.online/index.php/home), [Geomorphica](https://journals.psu.edu/geomorphica/), [Sedimentologika](https://oap.unige.ch/journals/sdk/index), [Advances in Geochemistry and Cosmochemistry](https://journals.uu.se/AGC/index), and soon [Geodynamica](https://www.geodynamica.org/). We will be the only diamond open access journal devoted to the interdisciplinary field of planetary science when we launch in January 2026.

The journal will operate with transparent governance and will provide opportunities for researchers at all career levels to participate in its operations. We acknowledge the critical need to make the results of scientific research accessible to society at large, and the journal will promote the work it publishes to the scientific community and the general public alike.

## How to participate

The journal will be run entirely by volunteers from the planetary science community and everyone is invited to participate in its development and operations. Most of our pre-launch discussions occur in an [online forum](#forum). We hold monthly [online meetings](#meetings) that we advertise both on the forum and through our [email distribution list](#email-list).

We currently have an open call for an [editor-in-chief](#editor-in-chief), [editors](#editors), [associate editors](#associate-editors), and members of the [media team](#media-team) and [technical team](#technical-team).
