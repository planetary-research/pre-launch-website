Journal principles
==================

*Planetary Research* is a not-for-profit journal that was created by members of the planetary science community through an open, inclusive, and transparent process. We are independent of any publisher or professional society, and we aim only to represent the authors who publish with us. As a community-led project, we adhere to a common set of principles and commit to achieving the following objectives.

* The journal commits to publishing high quality and ethical research that is free of cost, and free of unnecessary barriers.

* The journal commits to responding quickly and proactively to the evolving needs of its authors and readers.

* The journal commits to developing policies and procedures in an open and transparent manner.

* The journal commits to providing opportunities for researchers at all career levels to participate in its governance and operations.

* The journal commits to ensuring that the composition of its governing structures reflects the gender, age, and geographical diversity of its authors and readers.

* Recognizing that science advances by building on the work of others, the journal commits to making all data used in its articles, along with all significant derived data products, available to its readers.

* Recognizing the importance of making scientific work accessible to society at large, the journal commits to promoting the work it publishes to both the scientific community and general public alike.
