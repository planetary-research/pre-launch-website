# Online forum

Most discussions about the journal's development take place in our online Mattermost forum. We have several channels in our team that are dedicated to discussions about the journal's governance, editorial policies, peer-review process, website, branding, and outreach activities.

If you are interested in participating and contributing to the journal's development, then please consider becoming a member of the [Planetary Research Cooperative](https://coop.planetary-research.org). Membership is free, and once a member, an invitation link can be found on the member services web page.
