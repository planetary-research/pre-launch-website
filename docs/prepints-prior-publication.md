# Preprints and prior publication

*Planetary Research* will only consider for publication manuscripts that have not been previously published and that are not being concurrently considered for publication in another peer-reviewed journal. Peer-reviewed journals include those journals that have an editorial board and that solicit reviews of submitted manuscripts. Prior publication includes manuscripts that were published in a book, manuscripts that were published in another language, and manuscripts that are not significantly different from previously published work. Preprints, theses, dissertations, abstracts, oral presentations, and other formats that represent an unfinished state of the work are not considered as representing prior publication.

Authors may at any time during the peer-review process upload an author formatted manuscript to a preprint server, an online institutional archive, or a personal website. Following publication, the author may also upload the final journal formatted manuscript. After the manuscript has been accepted for publication, the author is encouraged to link any preprints to the final version of record on the journal's website.
