# Journal scope

*Planetary Research* is devoted to publishing original scientific research in the field of planetary science. We welcome work that is based on analyses of data derived from spacecraft and Earth-based observatories, laboratory measurements of extraterrestrial materials, theoretical and numerical modeling of planetary phenomena, and analyses of terrestrial analog sites and materials. Studies of other planetary systems and exoplanets are welcome when the investigation can be supported by experimental data or observations, and when the results are presented in a comparative planetology context. Studies about solar and stellar phenomena that impact planetary objects are also welcome. Studies in the field of astrobiology are welcome when they have consequences for the interpretation of planetary data. Manuscripts that focus on studies of Earth are welcome when they are presented in a comparative planetology context. Original research can be presented in the form of research articles or short letters, and additional article types are provided for reviews, the description of planetary missions and instrumentation, numerical codes, and datasets. Commentaries that express a point of view on a topic, or that discuss issues that may be of interest to the readers of the journal, are also welcome.
