# Editorial board

The editorial board is responsible for coordinating the peer review of manuscripts that are submitted to the journal. Each submitted manuscript is assigned to a single editor who is solely responsible for deciding whether the manuscript should be published or not. Associate editors may be called upon to assist in various aspects of the peer review process. Complaints will be moderated by the editor-in-chief.

## Editorial board roles

The editorial board is composed of the editor-in-chief, the editors, and the associate editors. The editor-in-chief of the journal is selected with the help of an editor search committee and is appointed by the Planetary Research Cooperative board of directors. Responsibilities of the editor-in-chief include enforcing all journal editorial policies, overseeing timely editorial board meetings, standardizing review procedures, and chairing an editor search committee that nominates new editors and associate editors. The editor-in-chief is by right a member of the Planetary Research Cooperative board of directors.

Editors are responsible for overseeing the peer review of manuscripts that are assigned to them. Editors contact reviewers, ask for revisions based on their assessment of reviews, and make a final determination of whether the manuscript should be published or not. The editor-in-chief may take on the role of an editor and oversee the peer review of manuscripts. New editors are nominated by an editor search committee and approved by the Planetary Research Cooperative board of directors.

Associate editors may be called upon by the editors to assist in the peer review process. Tasks may include providing independent assessments of manuscripts and reviews, and contacting reviewers on behalf of the editor. Associate editors are appointed directly by the editor-in-chief after consulting with the editorial board and editor search committee.

All open positions in the editorial board will be announced to the community and candidates will be evaluated by an editor search committee. All editorial board positions are for a term of four years and may be renewed. Renewal of the editor-in-chief and editor positions requires the approval of the board of directors, whereas associate editor renewals requires the approval of the editor-in-chief.
