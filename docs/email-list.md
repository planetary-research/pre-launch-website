# Email distribution list

Most of our discussions occur in our Mattermost forum, but we also use an email list to send occasional announcements.

To subscribe to the email list, you must first become a member of the [Planetary Research Cooperative](https://coop.planetary-research.org). Membership is free, and when signing up it is only necessary to choose to subscribe to the "Planetary Research (journal)" email list.
