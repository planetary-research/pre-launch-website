# Privacy statement

Any personal information that is collected while registering for an account with Planetary Research will be used solely for the purpose of running a peer-reviewed scientific journal. The collection of personal data will be kept to an absolute minimum, and will include names, email addresses, and ORCID iDs. Personal data will be used to manage manuscript submissions, to contact peer reviewers, and to send email alerts. No information regarding user accounts will be shared outside of the journal's editorial board.

As part of the peer review process, the journal is required to store copies of each submitted manuscript and all correspondence with the authors and reviewers. The only information that will be shared with the public is the final manuscript that is published on the journal website and the accompanying peer review report that contains the reviews, author rebuttals, and editor decisions. The journal will not provide any identifying information about the reviewers in the peer review report beyond what is in the unedited reviews. Users can ask to have their account with the journal deleted at any time, but in order to preserve a complete record of the peer review process, any prior submitted manuscripts and correspondence will not be deleted from the journal's internal records.
